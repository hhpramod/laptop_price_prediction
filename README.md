# laptop_price_prediction

 This project involves predicting laptop prices using a dataset with features such as brand, type, RAM, operating system, weight, touchscreen capability, IPS display, CPU, and GPU. You applied a Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

# Process Overview
Data Preprocessing: The data was cleaned and preprocessed, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.//Model Training: The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the Random Forest Regressor was trained on the training set.//Prediction and Evaluation: The model predicted laptop prices on the testing set. Its performance was evaluated using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The model achieved an R-squared value of 0.7847, indicating it explains about 78% of the variance in laptop prices. The MAE provides a measure of the average error in the predictions.

# Results
R-squared: 0.7847, showing a good fit of the model to the data.
MAE: This metric helps understand the average magnitude of errors in the predictions, giving a clear idea of how close the predictions are to the actual prices.
